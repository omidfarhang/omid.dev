He also studies various fields and always tries to stay up to date with IT and his professional activities. He always has interesting ideas and is an excellent choice for consultation. He is never idle, since whenever the project workload decreases, Omid transforms the project based on the latest developments in programming. Omid is someone I would like to work with again."

Omid has always been willing and able to lend a hand in solving problems for those that visited the support forum. He's done an excellent job when doing beta testing and has spent countless hours doing this tedious job. He would be an asset at what ever job he finally decides to except."
