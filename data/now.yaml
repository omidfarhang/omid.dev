    content: |
      Currently leading the frontend team at **Jibit**. My approach is focused on supporting and empowering my teammates rather than traditional top-down leadership and control.
  - title: 🚀 Exploring
    content: |
      I'm focused on exploring new technologies and trends instead of deep-diving into a single stack. Sharing these on my blog forces me to learn each one in more detail and get feedback on any misconceptions.
  - title: 🏥 Health
    content: |
      I'm fascinated by the health and medical world, from following the latest news to practical home remedies and OTC medication usage. Completing Yale University's "Introduction to Medical Software" course on Coursera was a very pleasant experience.
  - title: 📖 Reading
    content: |
      I'm not reading a specific book at the moment. Instead, I'm keeping up with articles on tech, health, and politics to stay well-rounded and avoid becoming a "One-Dimensional Man."
  - title: 🎵 Listening
    content: |
      I'm open to all genres, but music from the 1940s and 1950s has been giving me a special vibe lately. This mostly comes from the playlists and environments found in **Fallout 4**.
