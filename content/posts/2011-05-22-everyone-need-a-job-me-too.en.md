  Hey my blog readers!</p> 
  
  <p>
    How is it going? Did enjoy your days? What's new in your life?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A paid job is something essential for everyone, especially for a man in my age, I need to start my own life and need enough money for that so I must be looking for a paid job, I did look for that and tried some, yet I've had no luck. Once after finishing my school I started working at IRIB (Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting &#8211; Iran's national TV/Radio) and after working 9 months in there I found that it’s not the job I need, because of 2 reason, one is that I want to work for myself and not someone else, another reason is that there has been some people in there that I did not like, maybe they were not bad people, just not like me so I could not stay in there.

    The next job I tried has been one offered with my dad's friend, he said that need a computer operator in his store, to import and export accountant information, I accepted and went to there, but&#8230; since first day he start to behavior too bad and also use me for other works like going out to shop or&#8230;, that's not what we accepted so I left there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So I decide to stay home for a while and keep improving my computer skills, I started by blogging, writing small VB programs, joining web forums, beta testing windows based programs and also learning about other operation systems like Linux. After about 3-4 years during beta-testing my favorite windows program from my favorite security software company (Avira GmbH) I thought hey why not trying this one for job? during same time I met someone from their team (I don't name here, maybe they don't like I do) online and I got more interested in having a job in there so I contacted them, after they asked for my resume and other stuff I got help from my friends and prepared them and sent, but after a few days they rejected my job request. 🙁

  <p>
    I had not too much hope about that job as I know how they think of common people like me, but&#8230; well&#8230; anyway&#8230; never mind!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now this is my next try, trying a new job, working in my dad's store, maybe this can help me improve my budget for starting my own job, a software company or a computer reseller store or something, who know!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Because of the new job I might be online less than before, but I be will here every day, just not full time, I will try to buy a smart phone with my first income and stay online at work too!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'm not leaving internet, I will sleep at night, I will go to work a few hours and I will spend my other times online 🙂

    Enjoy every moment of your life!<br />-Omid</div>
