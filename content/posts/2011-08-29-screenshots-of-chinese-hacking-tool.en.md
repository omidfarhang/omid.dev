    <b>Schneier on Security:</b> It's hard to know how serious <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/slip-up-in-chinese-military-tv-show-reveals-more-than-intended-60619.html">this</a> really is:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The screenshots appear as B-roll footage in the documentary for six seconds­between 11:04 and 11:10 minutes &#8212; showing custom built Chinese software apparently launching a cyber-attack against the main website of the Falun Gong spiritual practice, by using a compromised IP address belonging to a United States university. As of Aug. 22 at 1:30pm EDT, in addition to <a href="http://ept.ms/oxUW6k">Youtube</a>, the whole documentary is <a href="http://military.cntv.cn/program/jskj/20110717/100139.shtml">available on the CCTV website</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The screenshots show the name of the software and the Chinese university that built it, the Electrical Engineering University of China's People's Liberation Army­direct evidence that the PLA is involved in coding cyber-attack software directed against a Chinese dissident group.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The software window says &#8220;Choose Attack Target.&#8221; The computer operator selects an IP address from a list­it happens to be 138.26.72.17­and then selects a target. Encoded in the software are the words &#8220;Falun Gong website list,&#8221; showing that attacking Falun Gong websites was built into the software.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A drop-down list of dozens of Falun Gong websites appears. The computer operator chooses Minghui.org, the main website of the Falun Gong spiritual practice.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The IP address <a href="http://www.ip-adress.com/whois/uab.edu">138.26.72.17</a> belongs to the University of Alabama in Birmingham (UAB), according to an online trace.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The shots then show a big &#8220;Attack&#8221; button on the bottom left being pushed, before the camera cuts away.
