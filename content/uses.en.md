This is a list of the hardware, software, and gear I use for my daily work as a software engineer. This page is inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

My general strategy for choosing software is to prioritize cloud/web applications followed by open-source solutions, focusing on tools that are cross-platform. I intentionally try to avoid being locked into any single ecosystem or platform.
