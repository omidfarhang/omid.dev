I am **Omid Farhang**, a **Frontend Software Architect** and **Senior Frontend Engineer** with over 10 years of experience in designing and developing complex web applications and leading high-performing teams.

My journey in technology has been defined by a unique blend of frontend artistry and backend stability. While I specialize in architecting scalable frontend solutions, implementing **Nx Monorepos**, and **Micro-frontends**, my roots as a Linux Administrator give me a deep understanding of the infrastructure that powers modern web applications. This dual perspective allows me to bridge the gap between user experience and system reliability.

### What I Do

- **Frontend Architecture:** At [JIBit](https://jibit.ir), I lead the frontend team and have spearheaded the design of proprietary Angular-based frameworks and the transition to unified monorepo architectures, increasing development efficiency by 40%.
- **Architectural Leadership:** I provide technical oversight across various frontend ecosystems, including Angular, React, and Vue, ensuring scalable solutions and high code quality through SOLID principles and design systems.
- **DevOps & Administration:** With a strong background in Linux administration (Arch, Debian), I optimize server configurations and ensure seamless CI/CD pipelines using Docker and modern DevOps practices.

### My Philosophy

I believe that great software is not just about writing code; it's about solving problems efficiently and creating systems that are as elegant as they are functional. I am passionate about automation, open-source, and mentoring teams to reach their full potential.
